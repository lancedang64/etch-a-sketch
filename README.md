# etch-a-sketch

    Introduction
Hi, in this project I built a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.
Live preview at https://lancedang64.github.io/etch-a-sketch/

    Description
On opening, the browser displays a 16x16 grid of squares.
If a square is hovered on by the mouse, the square will be filled in black.
Therefore, if the user drag their mouse along the grid, they will be leaving a trail of black ink.

On top of the grid is a reset button which will clear the old grid and create a new one.
The user is prompted a new number of squares per side ranging from 0 to 100
